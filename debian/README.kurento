==========

Kurento changes from upstream:

- Use 'debhelper (>= 9)': Debian packager uses version 10, but that
  is only available in 16.04 as backport. Default version for both 16.04
  and 14.04 is 9.
  Also changed in file 'debian/compat'.

- dh-autoreconf: debhelper 10 already depends on dh-autoreconf, but version 9
  doesn't.
